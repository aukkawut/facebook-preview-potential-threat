# facebook-preview-potential-threat
This repository will host 2 html files that can causes Facebook preview algorithm to think that it is not what it is via &lt;meta> tag. This might be a feature but in terms of security, this might causes potential issue like what happened in Thailand where there is a virus (or malicious script per se) that lures people by using fake preview to the reliable source. I don't know that they use this method or not (I did not inspect that). 

Disclaimer: This is for educational purpose. I do not intend to make this as a hacking toolkit for use.
